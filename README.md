# AlgorithmsGolang

I started working on this repo as a way to showcase my skills in algorithms and data structures. During the process I realized that there are some common pattern which can be extended to many type of algorithms. Any problem can be converted into one of these base patterns.

The number of problems I have here is more than the base patterns.

I have created this repository to provide those important patterns that will help people to prepare for interviews.

The algorithms here are not comprehensive and the repo is still a work in progress

## Patterns

### Dynamic Programming 
- Fibonacci Problem
- Frog Jumping Problem
- Coin Change Problem
- Game Scoring Problem
